A Lightweight Transformer-Based Framework for Self-Supervised Electrocardiogram Anomaly Detection with Domain-Specific Augmentations

Overview

This repository contains the implementation of a lightweight transformer-based framework for self-supervised anomaly detection in electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. Developed as a final project for MIT's 6.7960, this project leverages domain-specific anomaly injection and explores the use of self-supervised learning for detecting clinically relevant ECG anomalies.
